# MicroLibrary

MicroLibrary is a microservices-based library management system developed using Java Spring Boot. The system allows students to upload, donate, and reserve resources from their peers in a user-friendly environment. Resources are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, and administrators manage pick-up and drop-off locations.

## Features

- Resource Management: Upload and manage books, notes, and other educational resources.
- Reservation System: Reserve available resources with location-based pick-up points.
- Donation System: Donate unwanted educational resources with proof of condition.
- User Management: Manage user details and borrowing records.
- Metrics Tracking: Track donations and reservations to optimize resources.
